# Project Proposal - Straight Shooting
Author: Shalni Sundram
This project will be a simple take on Galaxian, an arcade game from 1979.

## Gameplay
1. Players use arrow keys to move the screen's gun and shoot at moving squares that travel across the screen
2. The number of points acquired per shot depends on the color of the square that it shoots.
3. The player wins if they score a certain number of points and lose if a "poisonous" square is shot.

## Inspiration
As a little girl, one of my biggest thrills was playing Halo with my brother, but it took a while to learn how to play.
This game is simple and accessible to anyone, gamer or not. Knowing that a game that I created entirely can be 
enjoyed by anyone is enough to motivate me to see the project to completion.

## Libraries
Along with Cinder, I plan to use a Cinder block called "PretzelGui", a C++ Graphic User Interface that will facilitate 
the implementation of the game settings and make the settings interactive for the user.

## Timeline and Goals
1. By the end of week 1, I will have the libraries set up, the project's organization set up, and a rough start on 
implementing logic that uses the PretzelGui library so that I am familiarized with it.
2. By the end of week 2, I will have the skeleton of the game at a minimum, meaning the game roughly functions as it 
supposed to and accomplishes or is close to accomplishing the objective.
3. The project will be finished by the end of week 3, after having had wrapped up the functionality and aesthetics.

## Possible Extensions
If I were to finish early, I would look into adding a timer that would finish the game, implementing more interesting 
graphics, and/or making the game more challenging.
