# CS 126 Final Project
* For my final project, I decided to use the Cinder creative coding package to write a simplified version of 
Galaxian, the 1979 arcade game.

# Rules
* The player must shoot at the "enemies" sliding across the top of the screen using the screen's gun to attain enough 
points to win 
* The player can move the gun with the right and left arrow keys
* The player can choose to play with the "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard" difficulty levels by selecting a toggle on the 
screen's left side

## Libraries and Tools
* Along with using Cinder and open gl, I also used PretzelGui - a cinder block - to create a simplified and more 
user-friendly interface for the game
