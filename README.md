# Straight Shooting
* This desktop application uses the Cinder creative coding package to write a simplified version of Galaxian, 
  the 1979 arcade game.

# Rules
* The player must shoot at the "enemies" sliding across the top of the screen using the screen's gun. The player must
shoot all enemies to win. If this is not done before time runs out, the player loses
* The player can move the gun with the right and left arrow keys
* The player can choose to play with the "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard" difficulty levels by selecting a toggle on the 
title page's left side. The player can then click "Launch" to start the game!

## Libraries and Tools
* Along with using Cinder and open gl, I also used PretzelGui - a cinder block - to create a simplified and more 
user-friendly, interactive interface for the game. More specifically, for the user, PretzelGui is mainly used to allow
selection of difficulty levels and to launch the game. For my sake, one of PretzelGui's samples was a good initial 
framework to begin writing the game.
